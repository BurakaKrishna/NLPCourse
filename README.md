# LightTag's NLP Course
This repository contains a collection of slides and excercies that provide an introduction to applied NLP. 
Their are many excellent resources on the web for learning NLP; as practitioners we often wish candidates came in with a deeper
understanding of the "boring/technical" aspects of NLP, like writing regular expressions, considering tradeoffs in tokenization
strategies or getting text into tensorflow.

This course aims to give students ample time and experience with such problems
